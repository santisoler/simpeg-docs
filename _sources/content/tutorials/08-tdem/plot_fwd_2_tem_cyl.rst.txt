Forward Simulation for Transient Response on a Cylindrical Mesh
===============================================================

Here we use the module *SimPEG.electromagnetics.time_domain* to simulate the
transient response for an airborne survey using a cylindrical mesh and a conductivity
model. We simulate a single line of airborne data at many time channels for a vertical
coplanar survey geometry. For this tutorial, we focus on the following:

    - How to define the transmitters and receivers
    - How to define the transmitter waveform for a step-off
    - How to define the time-stepping
    - How to define the survey
    - How to solve TDEM problems on a cylindrical mesh
    - The units of the conductivity/resistivity model and resulting data


Please note that we have used a coarse mesh larger time-stepping to shorten the
time of the simulation. Proper discretization in space and time is required to
simulate the fields at each time channel with sufficient accuracy.

Defining the Waveform
---------------------

Under *SimPEG.electromagnetic.time_domain.sources*
there are a multitude of waveforms that can be defined (VTEM, Ramp-off etc...).
Here we simulate the response due to a step off waveform where the off-time
begins at t=0. Other waveforms are discuss in the OcTree simulation example.

Create Airborne Survey
----------------------

Here we define the survey used in our simulation. For time domain
simulations, we must define the geometry of the source and its waveform. For
the receivers, we define their geometry, the type of field they measure and the time
channels at which they measure the field. For this example,
the survey consists of a uniform grid of airborne measurements.

Create Cylindrical Mesh
-----------------------

Here we create the cylindrical mesh that will be used for this tutorial
example. We chose to design a coarser mesh to decrease the run time.
When designing a mesh to solve practical time domain problems:

    - Your smallest cell size should be 10%-20% the size of your smallest diffusion distance
    - The thickness of your padding needs to be 2-3 times biggest than your largest diffusion distance
    - The diffusion distance is ~1260*np.sqrt(rho*t)

Create Conductivity/Resistivity Model and Mapping
-------------------------------------------------

Here, we create the model that will be used to predict time domain
data and the mapping from the model to the mesh. The model
consists of a long vertical conductive pipe and a resistive
surface layer. For this example, we will have only flat topography.

Define the Simulation
---------------------

Here we define the formulation for solving Maxwell's equations. Since we are
measuring the time-derivative of the magnetic flux density and working with
a conductivity model, the EB formulation is the most natural. We must also
remember to define the mapping for the conductivity model. Use *rhoMap* instead
of *sigmaMap* if you defined a resistivity model.
