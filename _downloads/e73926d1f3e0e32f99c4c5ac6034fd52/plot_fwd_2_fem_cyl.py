"""
Forward Simulation on a Cylindrical Mesh
========================================

Here we use the module *SimPEG.electromagnetics.frequency_domain* to simulate the
FDEM response for an airborne survey using a cylindrical mesh and a conductivity
model. We simulate a single line of airborne data at many frequencies for a vertical
coplanar survey geometry. For this tutorial, we focus on the following:

    - How to define the transmitters and receivers
    - How to define the survey
    - How to solve the FDEM problem on cylindrical meshes
    - The units of the conductivity/resistivity model and resulting data


Please note that we have used a coarse mesh to shorten the time of the simulation.
Proper discretization is required to simulate the fields at each frequency with
sufficient accuracy.

# Create Cylindrical Mesh
# -----------------------

# Here we create the cylindrical mesh that will be used for this tutorial
# example. We chose to design a coarser mesh to decrease the run time.
# When designing a mesh to solve practical frequency domain problems:
#
#     - Your smallest cell size should be 10%-20% the size of your smallest skin depth
#     - The thickness of your padding needs to be 2-3 times biggest than your largest skin depth
#     - The skin depth is ~500*np.sqrt(rho/f)
